As a senior full stack web developer 
An android app developer 
A graphic designer 

A client comes to you with a project of making a web application Particularly for android 

He wants to make a birthday wish card using html, css and Javascript 

He wants the web app to be dynamic 

This is what he wants 

I want to create a website participate for an android view

A birthday wishes for a friend of mine 

When he Click on the link 
There a messenge should pop out saying 

[For eight long years you’ve walked beside me, Langa, hand in hand,
A steady friend, my greatest luck, the one who understands.
You back my dreams without a doubt, in all I choose to do,
A shield, a light, a laughing soul who always pulls me through.
Though miles divide us on this day, my heart is where you are,
I send my prayers and birthday wishes riding on a star.
May adventures fill the years ahead, with joy we’ve yet to find,
And may our bond grow ever strong, in heart and soul entwined.]

Then below the poem 
Give a button and name it as next 

When he clicks on the next button a pop out text from left side should appear 

Saying 
[HAPPY BIRTHDAY BUDDY]

This message should come out or pop in one by one 
happy from left 
Birthday from top
Buddy from right

This message should appear on top as after the animation of the text
I want another photo to pop out from below 

Use the image Tag in html file 
Name it as [cake.png]

Just name it I'll add the photo myself 

And give a comment so that I'll get to know 

Then add another next button below it shouldn't be very close to the  photo

keep some distance so that it looks presentable 

When  clicked 
It should pop out a message saying 
[Have a blessed day
Enjoy your day 
Brother]





Note:
1. Use a joyful color for the background 
2. Don’t forgot to comment on the image tag
3. Use cake.png for the image file name 
4. Make it look clean 

And write the code in different files
Html
Css
Javascript
